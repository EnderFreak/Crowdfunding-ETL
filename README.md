# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Purpose
Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures.

Independent Funding has been growing, so now it needs to move all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. This way, the analytics team will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects.

From Module 8 - practiced ERD, SQL and Python on datasets provided and created our own. (PGAdmin, Jupyter Notebook)
